For the most part, they are correct in holding off on these giants of the parrot world. The macaw&rsquo;s larger size means a louder vocal volume, and its large beak can be downright intimidating, especially to nonbird people. Their size not only warrants shopping for a cage at the far end of the size scale, but their long tail feathers require a cage that is tall as well.

With enough interactive time with those in the household, this macaw's nippiness and moods can be solved.
