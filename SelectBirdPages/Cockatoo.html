The cockatoo&rsquo;s cuddly nature is definitely one of its biggest draws. The key to healthy, happy cockatoo relationship, however, is a balance of independent play and scheduled human interaction. After all, of all the species of companion parrot, cockatoos, would be most likely to find themselves on the therapist&rsquo;s couch to deal with co-dependency issues, complaining, if they could, &ldquo;I just want to be loved and appreciated.&rdquo; <br>
                <br>
              Cockatoos, can be quite vocal, which can make for a tricky situation for those who have close neighbors. Companion cockatoos come in two sizes: large cockatoos and small cockatoos. Large cockatoos are noticeably bigger, and include the umbrella, Moluccan, greater sulphur crest and triton. Smaller cockatoos include the bare eye, slender bill, Goffin&rsquo;s, rose breast, lesser sulphur crest and citron. </h2>
              <p>If you are sensitive to dust and dander, a cockatoo might aggravate your sinuses, because they (along with cockatiels and African grey parrots) produce powder-down (fine dust particles composed of feathers that have broken down).</p></td>
