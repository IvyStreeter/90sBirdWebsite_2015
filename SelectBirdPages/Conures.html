The head is a bold red, while the eye ring is a predominant white. They have red splashes on the wings in the vicinity of the shoulder. Immature birds are completely green and only acquire their red coloring at around six months old. Red Masked Conures are one of the larger types of conures. They are very playful, active birds that make good pets. Red Masked conures are very vocal, and can be rather noisy at times, but as they are good mimics, you can easily train them to talk.

It is lively, fun-loving, and acrobatic, making a very playful pet that will readily learn to perform tricks. It is extremely vocal, and is also very alert and an excellent watchdog; screeching loudly to herald the arrival of someone at the door, or to welcome its owner home after a hard days work.</h3>
              <h3>Sun conures are very demanding, requiring lots of attention and human interaction. They are ranked as one of the noisiest types of conures, and are therefore not recommended for apartment dwellers, or owners with a low tolerance level to noise. However, if you can put up with their screeching, they have beauty, brains, are big in character and make amazing pets.</h3>
