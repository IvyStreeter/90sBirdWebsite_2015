              <td><h2>Preening is how birds keep their feathers looking clean, water   proofed and in flying condition. Healthy birds spend a great deal of   preening because having neat feathers is very important to a bird&rsquo;s   survival. Feathers keep the bird insulated, weather proofed, and they   even help a bird find a mate.</h2>
                <h2>A preening bird looks like he is &ldquo;bothering&rdquo; his feathers with its   beak. What he&rsquo;s really doing is removing debris and breaking up   powder-down feathers, which grow close to the skin, into powder that   helps water proof the feathers. With the exception of Amazon parrots and   hyacinth macaws, the bird is also spreading &ldquo;preen gland&rdquo; oil through   the feathers, which helps with waterproofing and acts as a precursor to   Vitamin-D production. While preening the bird &ldquo;zips&rdquo; up his feathers;   each strand of each feather is like a little bit of Velcro that sticks   to the others to form a tight, neat feather. See, there&rsquo;s a lot going on   with this preening business!</h2>
                <h2>Birds like to preen after a bath and after meals. You will notice the   bird shake out his feathers after preening and may see a cloud of dust   emanating from the bird. This is part debris and part powder down. Some   birds, like African greys, cockatoos and cockatiels, have a lot of   powder down. Regular bathing can reduce the amount of powder down your   bird generates.</h2>
              <h2>Paired birds and those in a family flock will preen one another; this   is called allopreening, which not only helps keep the birds tidy, but   reinforces their bonds. A bird that isn&rsquo;t preening might be ill or   extremely uncomfortable in his living situation. A tattered and   ratty-looking bird that has stopped preening needs to see a veterinarian   right away.</h2></td>

              <td><h2>Bird novices are sometimes quick to misjudge their bird&rsquo;s behavior   and wonder why they received a bite or why the bird fluttered off their   hand. Does the bird want you to come to it, or move away? If you start   to understand what bird body language means, it&rsquo;s easy to read bird   behavior. Here are just a few things to watch for:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Eye Pinning</strong> In parrots with light-colored eyes, you   might notice the pupil dilating in and out when the bird becomes   excited. This happens a lot in Amazon parrots, macaws, <em>Poicephalus</em> and   African greys, but can happen in any parrot. Eye pinning means a   heightened excited state – this isn&rsquo;t a good time to stick your finger   into your parrot&rsquo;s face – you might just get a nasty bite.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Tail Flaring</strong> Birds shake their tail feathers after   preening or to release tension, but tail feather flaring is different;   this is when the tail feathers are flared out like a fan. Amazon parrots   are prone to this, but other types of parrots do this as well. This   indicates an excited state, and often appears with eye pinning.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Beak Clicking </strong>The clicking of the beak can indicate an excited state, but can also be a warning to stay away.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Feather Fluffing</strong> A bird will ruffle and fluff his   feathers after preening to remove debris and will also fluff his   feathers when it is cold. If a bird has his feathers continually   fluffed, the bird may be ill and is trying to keep warm.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Beak Wiping </strong>Birds will often wipe their beaks on perches or the cage bars after eating to remove debris, such as food.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Crest Position</strong> Some birds, like cockatiels,   cockatoos and hawk-headed parrots, have crest feathers that the bird   raises or lowers to indicate emotional state. If you have one of these   types of birds, watch to see what prompts the bird to raise its crest;    is it excited, fearful or happy?</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Shivering</strong> Birds shiver and shake after taking a   bath; their breast muscles involuntarily contract and expand to create   body heat. A bird may also appear to shiver when he is very excited.   Quaker parrots are known to &ldquo;quake,&rdquo; which is how they got their name.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Flapping Wings</strong> Birds often hold on tight to the   perch and flap their wings madly as if wanting to take off in flight.   They do this for exercise and when they&rsquo;re happy, and it can also be   part of breeding behavior.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Head Bobbing</strong> Head bobbing can indicate that a bird   is anxious to go somewhere, or perhaps he is regurgitating to you in an   effort to bond with you. Very young parrots bob their heads a lot, as do   quaker parrots.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Head Shaking</strong> African grey parrots shake their heads   a lot, as if something is in their ears. It is not certain why they do   this, but it&rsquo;s a normal behavior for this species.</h2>

              <td align="left" valign="top"><h2>There are some parrot behaviors that are absolutely mystifying to   people new to birds, but that are actually quite normal. Here&rsquo;s a   rundown of the Top 10 behaviors that people often ask about:</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Beak Grinding</strong> Many healthy birds grind the beak   just before drifting off to sleep. This is a normal behavior, and though   it&rsquo;s not certain why they do this, it is definitely a sign of being   content and comfortable.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Preening</strong> Birds preen continually throughout the day   to keep their feathers clean and neat. Preening is never a problem   until it becomes &ldquo;over preening&rdquo; and you notice that your bird is   actually chewing or plucking out feathers.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Regurgitating</strong> Regurgitating is when an adult bird   brings up partially digested food to feed a mate or chicks. Birds that   are closely bonded to their humans will also regurgitate to their owner —   a very sweet gesture, but quite unnecessary! If you want it to stop,   you can thank the bird and then just casually walk away. Regurgitation   is different from vomiting; a bird that&rsquo;s vomiting is ill, and the vomit   will likely stick to the feathers around the face and chest — this bird   needs medical attention.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Playing</strong> Yes, birds actually play just like kids!   Not all of their behavior is a function of biology. Birds are   intelligent creatures that will look for something to do rather than   just sit around in a cage, so it&rsquo;s important to have plenty of toys   available.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Cat Napping</strong> Birds take catnaps throughout the day,   which is completely normal, especially if the bird naps on a perch while   standing on one leg. If the bird is standing on two legs with its   feathers fluffed, he is either cold or possibly ill.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Freezing In Place</strong> A bird that is afraid might   freeze in place, not moving even a feather in hopes that he won&rsquo;t be   seen. This is because many predators&rsquo; eyes only pick up movement, so   they have a hard time distinguishing inanimate objects.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Hiding </strong>A bird that doesn&rsquo;t want to be put back into   the cage might hide at the back of the cage (on the outside) or find   somewhere else to hide — who said that bird brains aren&rsquo;t smart?</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Aggression </strong>Yes, sometimes aggression is normal   behavior. Some birds get hormonal in the spring and may try to protect   their cage. Others may not like a certain way of being handled, or are   perhaps acting out of jealousy. Whatever the case, aggression always has   a cause and can be quelled once the cause is discovered and handled   appropriately.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Egg Laying </strong>Female birds (hens) can lay eggs with or   without a mate present. This is normal behavior, and should only be   stopped if the lone hen lays too many eggs and spends too much time   tending to eggs that will never hatch. You can prevent hormonal triggers   by decreasing the amount of light your bird receives to less than 12   hours a day and removing any perceived nest sites.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Begging</strong> Some birds revert to &ldquo;baby&rdquo; begging   behavior to get what they want, especially if it has worked in the past.   This includes getting into a crouched position, scrunching the wings   up, bobbing the head and making chick noises. You can limit this   behavior by not indulging it, even though it can be kind of cute, at   first!</h2>

              <td align="left" valign="top"><h2>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a quiet bird. Some are quieter than others,   usually because of size — the bigger the bird, the louder the volume.   However, what small birds lack in volume, many make up for in   persistence. For some people, the intermittent squawking of a macaw is   more acceptable than the persistent low cooing of doves. In any case,   there&rsquo;s no way to get a bird to be completely quiet, or to be quiet when   you desire. Making noise is instinctual for birdsl, it is how they   communicate, form bonds and defend themselves. Here are some forms of   normal birdie communication:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Chattering</strong> Small birds chatter throughout the day   for various reasons. Most birds are the most vocal at dawn and dusk,   when they&rsquo;re getting ready to feed. Some small birds will even chatter   in their sleep during the day, a protective adaptation to show predators   that they are awake and alert, not catnapping and vulnerable.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Screaming</strong> Some parrots scream and screech, which is   normal to a degree. Parrots that scream the loudest are those that tend   to mingle in mixed groups, like many of the South American species.   They have to be loud to be heard over the din of so many voices. Species   that tend to stick together in a single-species flock are often quieter   — not necessarily less persistent, but slightly lower in volume. These   include many of the African species.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Contact Calling</strong> You may notice that your bird seems   to &ldquo;call&rdquo; you persistently and won&rsquo;t quiet down until you enter the   room. In the wild, this is called &ldquo;contact calling.&rdquo; Birds like to know   where their partners are, so they call loudly expecting that the other   will call back. This helps partners locate each other and affirms that   both are safe. Your bird may want to participate in &ldquo;contact calling&rdquo;   with you. It&rsquo;s really easy — if you sense that your bird is calling you,   either by screaming or whistling, simply call back that you&rsquo;re okay.   You can make a game of it. This helps the bird feel secure and will   usually quiet him down after a few calls — well, depending on the bird!</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Talking &amp; Whistling</strong> Many parrots can learn to   mimic human speech, and some can even learn to understand what they are   saying and use words in context. You can&rsquo;t really &ldquo;teach&rdquo; your bird to   talk; either it will or it won&rsquo;t. The best you can do is talk to the   bird a lot and repeat specific words and phrases that you&rsquo;d like him to   learn. Birds are confounding sometimes; it&rsquo;s likely your bird will learn   something you didn&rsquo;t want him to! If your bird doesn&rsquo;t learn to talk,   it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he isn&rsquo;t smart; perhaps he is not of a species that   can learn to talk. Also, the females of some species are less likely to   speak than males.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Hissing &amp; Growling</strong> Cockatiels and African greys   are known for hissing and growling when they feel threatened. If a bird   hisses and growls at you, back off. This means that the bird feels   cornered and may lash out to protect himself.</h2>

Well, they don&rsquo;t usually bite <em>successfully</em> in   the wild, but they will snap at each other if it becomes necessary, for   example, if one bird invades another&rsquo;s nest or territory. Birds do bite   a lot more in captivity, usually because their boundaries are being   pushed too far. All birds have a threshold of what they can handle   before they lash out with a bite. There are other good reasons for a   bird to bite as well. Here are some details about birds that bite:</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Rule #1</strong> The first rule in teaching a bird not to   bite is not to get bitten. When a bird bites, he usually gets what he   wants from the action — you will go away and leave him alone. You will   also make a big fuss over the bite, which can be attractive to the bird,   an animal that loves drama. Rather than reinforce the behavior, just   don&rsquo;t let it happen. Learn to &ldquo;read&rdquo; your bird so that you can assess   the situation and get out before the bite happens.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Fear Biting </strong>You can hardly blame a bird that bites   out of fear, even if the fear is unfounded. Look at the world from your   bird&rsquo;s perspective and try not to put him in situations that will   frighten him.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Hormonal Biting</strong> In the spring when the days get   longer, some birds are prompted into breeding mode and may become   territorial of their housing area, of another bird, or of a person in   the household. This can usually be dealt with by adjusting the amount of   light the bird gets a day to less than 12 hours.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Jealousy Biting </strong>Sometimes, a bird will love his   person so much, and then suddenly chomp down on him or her when someone   else comes into the room. This actually has practical application in   nature, although it is unpleasant. In the wild, a member of a pair will   shoo away their beloved when another bird, a threat to the pair, flies   into the territory. The &ldquo;jealous&rdquo; bird is simply protecting their mate   and their relationship. If you know that your bird does this, make sure   that you can put him down before someone comes into the room, and don&rsquo;t   ever allow this bird to ride on your shoulder.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Molting </strong>Some birds become irritable when they are   molting and may not be feeling 100 percent. The same goes for birds that   are ill or injured.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Counteractive Biting</strong> Some birds bite to prevent you   from performing or not performing an action, for example a bird that   bites when being brought back to the cage because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be   locked in. As an aside, some birds that don&rsquo;t like to be put back into   the cage pretend that they have wobbly legs and that they can&rsquo;t stand up   just as you put them away — what a great tactic for not stepping onto a   perch! To prevent &ldquo;put away&rdquo; biting, don&rsquo;t put your bird away every   time you pick him up. Instead, do something fun, or play a little game   before you put your bird away; mix it up so that the bird isn&rsquo;t sure   what&rsquo;s coming next, and make it fun!</h2>

              <td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Screaming birds are a big issue with bird owners, who often don&rsquo;t   know what they&rsquo;re getting themselves into when they bring a bird home.   Some screaming (or vocalization) is normal — it becomes a problem when   it is persistent and drives you crazy, and perhaps your neighbors a   little nuts. Loud birds like these often get re-homed over and over   again because no one can stand the noise. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that once a   pattern of screaming is developed, it is very difficult to break, but   not impossible. You just have to have realistic expectations about how   much volume you can turn down. You also have to allow your bird some   screaming time when it would be normal for him to scream, such as in the   morning and at dusk. Beyond that, you can try to break the screaming   pattern in a variety of ways. Here are some tips:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Try To Figure Out Why The Bird Is Screaming.</strong> Is the   bird lonely because he is not getting enough attention? There may be a   simple explanation for the noise. If the bird is lonely, give him more   attention! But be sure to give him attention only when he is being   quiet. This way you don&rsquo;t reinforce the noise.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Has The Bird Learned That You Will Come Running When It Screams?</strong> Many   birds come to realize pretty quickly that screaming gets their person&rsquo;s   attention. Many people run to a screaming bird to shut him up,   especially when the rest of the family is protesting the loud mouth&rsquo;s   presence in the house. Rather than be at your bird&rsquo;s beck and call,   notice quiet moments and give your bird attention then, rather than when   he is screaming.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Has The Bird Learned That You Will Lose Your Temper When It Screams?</strong> Birds   love when their people lose their tempers; then they scream back! How   much fun! Try to remain calm and mellow, and just walk away from a   screaming bird and give yourself a timeout.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Lower The Noise In The House. </strong>Is the bird competing   with other household noise? Is the TV and the radio on, are the kids   screaming, and are the dogs barking — all at the same time? If so, your   bird is just trying to be heard above it all. Turn down the volume in   the house.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Is The Bird Screaming For A Mate?</strong> A bird that   starts screaming in the springtime might be calling for a mate. This   should subside in the fall. In the meantime, give the bird some   attention, especially when he is quiet.</h2>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2><strong>Cover The Bird. </strong>Covering the bird is a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo;   for screaming. Yes, it will stop the screaming for the time being, but   it will not prevent future screaming, nor will it teach the bird not to   scream. Birds are instinctively quiet at night, when most of their   predators are prowling and they are most vulnerable. It is not   appropriate to cover a bird for long periods during the day, so consider   this if you&rsquo;re regularly using this tactic.</h2>

Plucking often has a precipitating incident that causes the behavior,   but it can also stem from medical causes. In some birds, the plucking   becomes an entrenched habit that is difficult, even impossible to   change, but it is possible to modify the behavior once you find the   cause.</h2>
                <h2>First, you have to get to the root of the plucking, which isn&rsquo;t   always possible. The very first thing that a plucking or chewing bird   needs is a complete medical evaluation. The bird may have a skin problem   or infection that is causing the behavior. Also, where the bird is   plucking is important. Birds with respiratory infections tend to pluck   around the chest, and birds with leg or foot issues pluck in that area.</h2>
                <h2>If your bird comes back with a clean bill of health, then it is time   to start looking for environmental causes. Is the air very dry in your   area? Perhaps the bird needs more baths to keep the skin moist?</h2>
                <h2>Has there been a change in environment? Have you moved the bird, or   have you moved something &ldquo;scary&rdquo; or disturbing into the bird&rsquo;s immediate   area? Birds have been known to start plucking over simple things like   the presence of balloons, a new computer monitor or new artwork. Have   you painted recently or put down new carpet? Both contribute to poor air   quality, which can precipitate plucking. Has the bird recently lost a   mate or a birdie friend? Has some one moved into the household who the   bird doesn&rsquo;t like?</h2>
                <h2>Poor nutrition can also cause plucking behavior. Nutrition   contributes to a bird&rsquo;s overall health, and when his health is   compromised, so is his behavior. It is thought that plucking birds may   need a protein and vitamin boost, which may stop the behavior.</h2>
                <h2>Is the bird bored? Perhaps the plucking or chewing behavior is simply   an effort to find something to do. A plucking bird should be offered a   lot of toys, especially preening and soft-rope toys; ideally, the bird   will turn the over-preening behavior onto his toys.</h2>
                <h2>Is the bird hormonal? A frustrated bird may turn to plucking behavior   to relieve a little bit of his energy. The bird may also be frustrated   that he doesn&rsquo;t have a mate or another bird to preen with.</h2>
                <h2>Has your routine changed? Is the bird getting enough attention? Is he   getting enough sleep? Remember, birds are creatures of habit, and they   like routine. Sometimes the addition of an infant or a new pet to a home   causes plucking, because the bird is no longer the center of attention.</h2>
              <h2>If you have a plucking bird, try every remedy possible — nutritional,   environmental, behavioral — something may work. There has been a lot of   success with changing this behavior simply by offering the plucking   bird more nutritional foods and supplementing the diet with appropriate   vitamins and minerals.</h2></td>

This is actually quite normal behavior, though it   can be heartbreaking to the people who the bird shuns, especially if the   bird was supposed to be a certain person&rsquo;s bird; for example, a wife   brings a bird home to be her companion, but the feathered traitor likes   the husband instead.</h2>

Ten hours of light per day should help the hormones subside.

                <h2>Try not to engage in rough play with your bird. This makes the bird   think that he can be rough right back, which can result in a bite. Then   you&rsquo;ll be angry at the bird, and he won&rsquo;t know what he has done wrong   when playtime is abruptly stopped.</h2>
              <h2>Many birds like to be stroked around the head and neck. Some will   even appreciate your help in gently removing the sheaths around new   feathers growing in that area since the bird can&rsquo;t get to them himself.   Pet the bird gently against the &ldquo;grain&rdquo; of the feathers to get to the   skin beneath, and rub the bird&rsquo;s cheeks in soft circles. Many birds   really enjoy this kind of touching.</h2></td>

You can give your bird &ldquo;indirect   attention&rdquo; simply by allowing your bird to be in the room with you as   you do your chores or work. Your bird will be happy spending time with   you even if you are not holding him all the time.</h2>
                <h2>Indirect entertainment is anything outside of the bird&rsquo;s reach that   keeps him occupied. For example, having a TV or radio on is a comfort   for a lot of birds. A bird&rsquo;s environment in the wild is never quiet. In   fact, stillness and quiet can be stressful on a bird. So, a little   background noise is always appropriate. Parrots also appreciate visual   stimulation. Perhaps putting the bird where he can see outside the   window would be entertaining.</h2>
                <h2>Placing the parrot in a lively room can also make him feel part of   the action. A TV room or family room is ideal. People coming and going   can talk to the bird as they pass and keep him entertained. A parrot   sitting alone in a quiet room is a lonely parrot indeed.</h2>
              <h2>Bird sitting DVDs are becoming popular now. Many of them show birds   in the wild (and in captivity) interacting with each other, making noise   and playing. It&rsquo;s not certain that birds actually watch the DVDs on the   TV, but they will at the very least appreciate the noise.</h2></td>

              <td align="left" valign="top"><h2>Giving a parrot the attention and focus he requires can be a lot to   handle. Often, getting the bird a birdie &ldquo;friend&rdquo; can take away some of   the established bird&rsquo;s loneliness. Some people feel that birds should be   with other birds, and some hormonal birds even demand it! The biggest   pro to getting your bird a friend is that the pair will never be alone   and will keep each other entertained  — well, in a perfect world that   would be the case. The biggest con is that your established bird will no   longer want to have such a close bond with you.</h2>
                <h2>Ideally, a new bird will get along with your established bird, but   there are a lot of things that can go wrong, too. The birds could   actually despise each other. What will you do then? Now you have just   doubled your problem. The birds could be indifferent to each other;   again, double the trouble. Now you have to split your time between two   birds.</h2>
              <h2>It is never a good idea to buy a bird for another bird unless you   know that the two will bond. Remember, both birds are your   responsibility, and double the birds means double the mess, noise and   bills. Only buy another bird &ldquo;for&rdquo; your current bird if you&rsquo;re able to   take on another companion.</h2></td>
