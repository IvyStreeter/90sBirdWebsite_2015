          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. Birds will often stand on one foot to minimize heat loss. Some birds with fleshy feet, such as doves, have relatively short legs and can hunker down so their warm belly is pressed against their feet while perched, but accipiters, such as the young Cooper's Hawk pictured below, have longer legs that make this far more difficult. These birds will often hold one foot inside their belly feathers to minimize heat loss, and often switch back and forth between their feet.</h3></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h4>Q. A bird keeps flying into my window or car mirror, on purpose. What should I do?</h4></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. The behavior you mention often occurs in spring and early summer. This is the time of year when most birds establish their territories, find a mate, lay eggs, and raise young. To ensure success, they defend their territory aggressively, and will attack and try to drive away any bird they view as a possible competitor or a threat to their young. When they see their own reflection in your window, they assume they're seeing a competitor and attack the image. The species most likely to do this are those that nest close to houses, such as American Robins, Northern Cardinals, bluebirds, California Towhees, Chipping Sparrows, and Song Sparrows. Both males and females engage in this.</h3>
              <h3>Fortunately, this behavior usually dissipates within a few days or, at most, weeks. But while it lasts, the bird may exhaust or even hurt itself, and it distracts the bird from far more important activities. And this behavior can be extremely annoying for the people witnessing it.</h3>
              <h3>To get rid of the reflection, you must alter the outside of the window. You can cover it with netting, fabric, or newspaper, or smear soap streaks on the glass. When you're no longer seeing the bird nearby you can remove this. Often, rubber snakes frighten birds away, at least temporarily—although like any object that doesn't move, the birds get used to seeing them. Helium-filled Mylar balloons on 3–4 foot strings make movements and cast glaring light that birds find confusing and even alarming. Setting a few near a window will frighten away most birds.</h3></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. Many animals engage in &ldquo;play,&rdquo; that is, activities that enhance learning of motor and sensory skills and social behaviors but otherwise serve no immediate purpose. Young screech-owls pounce at leaves; young crows and jays pick up, inspect, and hide all kinds of shiny objects; young gulls and terns carry small items aloft and drop them, catch them in midair, and drop and catch them again. All these activities probably help birds acquire the skills and coordination they&rsquo;ll need for hunting and other essential activities as adults.</h3>
              <h3>Some forms of play, called &ldquo;locomotor play,&rdquo; seem quite similar to the exhilarating play of children sledding down a steep hill. Some ducks have been observed floating through tidal rapids or fast-moving sections of rivers, and when they&rsquo;ve reached the end, hurrying back to the beginning to ride over and over. Common Ravens have been observed taking turns sliding down a snowbank on their tails or rolling over and over down a hill. In the air, ravens and crows often rise on air currents only to swoop down toward earth, then glide back upwards, again and again.</h3></td>

            <td><h4>Q. Why do birds have such elaborate and varied courtship rituals?</h4></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. Courtship displays are a form of communication, enabling birds to signal their willingness to mate. They also give the birds an opportunity to assess their partner. A female bird invests a great deal of energy in producing eggs, incubating them, and raising the young. Courtship displays can help her select a mate who is most likely to produce healthy young. She may look for clues about his health, vigor, or ability to provision the young, based on his appearance, his display, or his song.</h3>
              <h3>For example, a male bird may show off his brightly colored plumage because bright colors indicate his health or ability to find good food. A male Snail Kite offers his mate a stick or a snail, perhaps a sign of his ability to provide materials for a nest and his superior hunting skills. Male songbirds may sing repeatedly to advertise their vigor or experience. Female Northern Mockingbirds may prefer males that sing the most song variations. Since older males typically sing more songs, a larger repertoire may indicate longevity and experience in raising young.</h3>
              <h3>One of the most astounding examples of courtship displays is found in the birds-of-paradise of Australia and New Guinea.</h3></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A: At some point, nearly everyone who spends time outdoors finds a baby bird—one that is unable to fly well and seems lost or abandoned. Your first impulse may be to help the young bird, but in the great majority of cases the young bird doesn't need help. In fact, intervening often makes the situation worse. Here&rsquo;s how to determine whether to take action:</h3>
              <h3>The first thing to do is to figure out if the baby bird is a nestling or a fledgling.</h3>
              <h3>Most of the baby birds people find are fledglings. These are young birds that have just left the nest, are still under the care of their parents, and do not need our help. Fledglings are feathered and capable of hopping or flitting, with toes that can tightly grip your finger or a twig. These youngsters are generally adorable and fluffy, with a tiny stub of a tail.</h3>
              <h3>When fledglings leave their nest they rarely return, so even if you see the nest it's not a good idea to put the bird back in—it will hop right back out. Usually there is no reason to intervene at all beyond putting the bird on a nearby perch out of harm's way and keeping pets indoors. The parents may be attending to four or five young scattered in different directions, but they will return to care for the one you have found. You can watch from a distance to make sure the parents are returning to care for the fledgling.</h3>
              <h3>If the baby bird is sparsely feathered and not capable of hopping, walking, flitting, or gripping tightly to your finger, it's a nestling. If so, the nest is almost certainly nearby. If you can find the nest (it may be well hidden), put the bird back as quickly as possible. Don't worry—parent birds do not recognize their young by smell. They will not abandon a baby if it has been touched by humans.</h3>
              <h3>If you have found both parents dead, the young bird is injured, you can't find the nest, or are absolutely certain that the bird was orphaned, then your best course of action is to bring it to a wildlife rehabilitator. A sick, injured or orphaned baby bird may need emergency care until you can get it to a wildlife rehabilitator.</h3>
              <h3>Bottom line: remember that the vast majority of "abandoned" baby birds are perfectly healthy fledglings whose parents are nearby and watching out for them.</h3></td>

            <td><h4>Q: If I don't pick up a baby bird, will my cat or dog kill it?</h4></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A: It might if it gets the chance. The best thing to do is to keep your pet inside, or leashed well away from the fledgling until the bird is gone. This helpless stage lasts at most a few days, and if you leave the young bird under the care of its parents, it will have a far greater chance of thriving over a lifetime.</h3></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. We strongly advise you not to, for two reasons. First, it violates federal and state laws, such as the Migratory Bird Act, to possess any wild native American bird for any length of time without proper permits. Second, even with expert care and feeding, people simply cannot provide baby birds with most of the skills they need to negotiate the natural world.</h3>
              <h3>For excellent, well-reasoned information about the pros and cons of raising baby birds in captivity, visit Dr. Kevin McGowan's webpage, "I Found a Baby Crow." Much of the information about baby American Crows applies to other songbirds as well. </h3>

          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. It's a myth that parent birds will abandon young that have been touched by humans—most birds have a poor sense of smell, and birds in general identify their young using the same cues we humans do—appearance and sound. It's perfectly safe to pick up a fallen nestling and put it back in the nest, or to carry a fledgling out of danger and place it in a tree or shrub.</h3></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. Rehabbers almost never incubate eggs. If the eggs have fallen from the nest or been handled by people, the chances are just too great that the growing embryo has been shaken. If the egg eventually hatches, the hatchling is likely to suffer from grave deformities.</h3></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h4>Q. Why do birds leave the nest before they can fly?</h4></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><h3>A. It's to some young birds' advantage to leave the nest as soon as they can. People tend to think of nests as safe, cozy little homes. But predators have a pretty easy time finding a nest full of loud baby birds, and nests can be hotbeds of parasites. Parent birds work from sunrise to sunset every day to get their young grown and out of the nest as quickly as possible. After fledging, the young birds are more spread out, and the parents can lead them to different spots every night, enhancing each one's chances of survival. During this vulnerable time, you can help young birds by making sure your pets are indoors, or closely monitored when outside.</h3>
              <h3>Other young birds may stay in their nests until they are capable of flight. Species such as swallows, woodpeckers, and other cavity nesters nest where there are no nearby branches for young to awkwardly grab onto when they first leave the nest. Unless startled by a predator, young of these species tend to remain in the nest until they are strong fliers.</h3></td>
